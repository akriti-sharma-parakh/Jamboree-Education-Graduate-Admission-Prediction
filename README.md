# Jamboree-Education-Graduate-Admission-Prediction
Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Here, we analyzed a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.

Here, we developed a linear regression model to predict graduate admission chances using GRE, TOEFL, GPA, and research experience. Conducted EDA, feature engineering, multicollinearity checks, and residual diagnostics to ensure model validity. Evaluated performance with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics, providing insights for improving admission prediction and strategic decision-making.
